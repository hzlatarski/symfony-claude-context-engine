Compile daily conversation logs into structured knowledge articles.

This is the "LLM compiler" - it reads daily logs (source code) and produces
organized knowledge articles (the executable).

Usage:
    uv run python compile.py                    # compile new/changed logs only
    uv run python compile.py --all              # force recompile everything
    uv run python compile.py --file daily/2026-04-01.md  # compile a specific log
    uv run python compile.py --dry-run          # show what would be compiled

{compiled_truth if compiled_truth else "(No compiled truth yet — run compile_truth.py first)"}

## Daily Log to Compile

**File:** {log_path.name}

{log_content}

## Your Task

Read the daily log above and compile it into wiki articles following the schema exactly.

### Rules:

1. **Extract key concepts** - Identify 3-7 distinct concepts worth their own article
2. **Create concept articles** in `knowledge/concepts/` - One .md file per concept
   - Use the Truth + Timeline format from AGENTS.md:
     * `## Truth` section with TWO subsections:
       - `### Observed` — facts extracted DIRECTLY from the source. Every bullet
         MUST end with at least one `[src:daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md]` anchor pointing
         to the daily log the fact came from. The anchor is mandatory, not
         optional — without it the claim cannot be re-verified by lint.
       - `### Synthesized` — compiler inferences drawn from combining multiple
         Observed facts. Use sparingly and only when the inference is
         non-obvious. Also anchor where possible.
     * `### Related Concepts` subsection (under Truth): [[wikilinks]] with
       one-line descriptions
     * `---` horizontal rule separator
     * `## Timeline` section: per-source entries documenting what was learned and when
   - Include `sources:` in frontmatter pointing to the daily log file
   - Include `confidence:` in frontmatter (0.0-1.0) based on how validated the info is:
     * 0.8-1.0: Firm decisions, verified facts, implemented and tested
     * 0.6-0.8: Patterns observed multiple times, strong consensus
     * 0.4-0.6: Single observation, reasonable but unverified
     * 0.2-0.4: Speculation, tentative plans, may change
   - Include `type:` in frontmatter — exactly one of the six canonical values:
     * `fact` — static knowledge not bound to a moment ("Stimulus uses kebab-case")
     * `event` — something that happened on a date ("launched onboarding v2")
     * `discovery` — finding from debugging/investigation ("root cause: missing index on sessions.user_id")
     * `preference` — user preference or stylistic rule ("don't mock the database in tests")
     * `advice` — actionable guidance for future sessions ("run Tailwind rebuild after editing app.css")
     * `decision` — locked-in architectural choice ("using framework X, not framework Y")
     Pick the MOST specific type that fits. When genuinely uncertain, default to `fact`.
     An unknown value here fails lint — use exactly one of the six above.
   - Write Truth in encyclopedia style — dense, factual, no "we discovered"
3. **Create connection articles** in `knowledge/connections/` if this log reveals non-obvious
   relationships between 2+ existing concepts
4. **Update existing articles — with skeptical verification** if this log adds
   new information to concepts already in the wiki:
   - Read the existing article with the Read tool
   - Compare the new info against the article's current Truth section
   - **If the new info CORROBORATES existing Truth:** merge it, bump confidence
     by 0.1 (capped at 1.0), add the daily log to frontmatter sources
   - **If the new info CONTRADICTS existing Truth:** do NOT silently overwrite.
     Instead:
       (a) Keep the existing Truth unchanged
       (b) Append a `### Conflict <YYYY-MM-DD>` subsection to Timeline documenting
           both the old and new claim with evidence from each source
       (c) Emit a line in your final response starting with `CONTRADICTION: `
           followed by `[concepts/<slug>]` or `[connections/<slug>]` or `[qa/<slug>]`
           and a one-line description, using the exact bracket format so that
           lint.py can parse it
       (d) LOWER confidence by 0.1 (floor 0.1) to reflect the unresolved conflict
   - **If the new info EXTENDS existing Truth** (adds non-conflicting detail):
     merge it into Key Points without changing confidence
   - Never overwrite a factual claim in Truth without running the above check
5. **Update knowledge/index.md** - Add new entries to the table
   - Each entry: `| [[path/slug]] | One-line summary | source-file | {timestamp[:10]} |`
6. **Append to knowledge/log.md** - Add a timestamped entry:
   ```
   ## [{timestamp}] compile | {log_path.name}
   - Source: daily/{log_path.name}
   - Articles created: [[concepts/x]], [[concepts/y]]
   - Articles updated: [[concepts/z]] (if any)
   ```
7. **Use tools to check existing articles** — The wiki index above lists every article
   with its path and one-line summary. Before creating a new article, check the index
   for duplicates or near-duplicates. To update an existing article, use the Read tool
   to fetch it first, then Edit to modify it. Use Grep to search for related concepts
   when adding [[wikilinks]].

### File paths:
- Write concept articles to: {CONCEPTS_DIR}
- Write connection articles to: {CONNECTIONS_DIR}
- Update index at: {KNOWLEDGE_DIR / 'index.md'}
- Append log at: {KNOWLEDGE_DIR / 'log.md'}

### Quality standards:
- Every article must have complete YAML frontmatter
- Every article must link to at least 2 other articles via [[wikilinks]]
- Key Points section should have 3-5 bullet points
- Details section should have 2+ paragraphs
- Related Concepts section should have 2+ entries
- Sources section should cite the daily log with specific claims extracted
